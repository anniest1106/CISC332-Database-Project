# CISC332-Database-Project
<b>Carshare</b><br>

The course project is intended to give students an opportunity to participate in all phases of the development of a database application. 
The development of the application requires students to use ER modeling techniques, relational modeling techniques, MySQL and PHP. 
Projects can be done in groups of up to 2 individuals which in this case I had done this project with Renee Xu.

We required to develop a database that can be used to provide the backend support for a new car sharing venture in Kingston called
K-Town Car Share (KTCS for short). KTCS plans to maintain a fleet of cars placed in several locations across Kingston. Members of 
KTCS will be able to reserve a car from the KTCS online system and then pick it up at a designated location using their unique member 
number. When they are done with the car they return it to the same location and notify KTCS via the KTCS application web site. Members 
will pay an annual membership fee for the service and then an hourly rental rate for each use. Members will also be able to post on-line 
reviews and comments on their experience with a particular vehicle or with KTCS in general. Your task is to provide the database and 
related functionality required by the KTCS system. <br>
